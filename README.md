# Online Name Changing

Project done as part of IBM Code Challenge.
Based on Theme 1 (As per guidelines):
    Making the process involving Govt easier online.
This project attempt to make the person's 'name changing' process easier online.
Conventional mode of Name changing involves mainly 2 steps:
    - Create an affidavit for change of name (On a 20 Ruppee stamp paper)
    - Publish about your name change in Newspaper
    - Notify it in State Gazette
An affidavit needs to be made explaining why the name change is required. These details need to be included in the affidavit.
The applicant should sign the affidavit and get it attested by a Notary or Judicial Magistrate or an Oaths Commissioner.
After Notarizing the affidavit, you need to publish the change of your name in two local newspapers in Kerala.

The proposed solution consist of 2 applications.
1. A Mobile Application - For the end user (Who needs the service)
2. A Web Application -  For the authories and Officials to act upon the request from users.

This repository contains the Mobile Application.
    The application requires the user to login first. If the user is visiting for the first time he/she need to register.
    It provides the options to apply for a name change
    Track the status of the request (Not Implemented)
    See and Review the Application
